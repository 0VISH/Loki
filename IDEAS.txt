1) Have features such as
  - Catch exceptions, and show usefull msg.
  - Array bounds check.
  - Integer bounds check.
  - Stack trace(use lvl).
These features can be chosen by user when he is building. For dbg build we would like to enable all. For rls build nothing will be enabled.
But if the usr wants certain feature he can enable it even during rls build.

2) Multiple backends compiled to .dll
  - C backend.
  - Compile directly to LLVM ir. Then feed it to clang, etc...
  - Custon backend.

3) Have a build.xe file, telling the compiler how to build the solution.

4) Symmetry, simplicity, and singularity(syntax which does one thing at a time. No overloading, etc...).

5) Push type and/or size of the argument when calling a function???

6) Allow comptime execution to
  - Run math operations
  - Fill a ds and bake it into the exe. Load the baked data during runtime.
  - Get info about the build system.
